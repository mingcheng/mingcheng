## Greetings! ðŸ‘‹

My name is mingcheng(æ˜ŽåŸŽ). I'm originally from Ningbo China, and currently based in Hangzhou.

I work as an open-source evangelist at [Ant Group](https://github.com/antgroup). I serve as a Project Management Committee (PMC) member for the [Apache Software Foundation](https://apache.org/) and maintain several open-source projects, including [InclusionAI](https://github.com/inclusionAI) ([Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/inclusionAI)) and [Dragonfly](https://github.com/dragonflyoss) (a CNCF incubating project) and [Apache Geaflow](https://github.com/apache/geaflow). I'm also pursuing a Master's degree in Data Science and Business Analytics at [SISU (Shanghai International Studies University)](https://shisu.edu.cn), which I expect to graduate in 2026.

As shown in the statistics above, I'm passionate about programming languages. I primarily work with Rust, Golang, TypeScript, Java, Python and R. I'm enthusiastic about Rust and Golang for writing open-source projects. Programming languages are not only just tools, but also they're a medium for exploring technology and expressing creativity to me. I'm also enthusiastic about the Linux platform (Debian and Arch Linux), which I used for them for decades, and cloud-native technologies. Currently, I'm learning more about AI agents, data analytics, and related fields.

You may find out more about me from [this link](https://mingche.ng), if you're interested.
