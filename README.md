## Greetings! 👋

<img align="right" alt="" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mingcheng/langstat/refs/heads/data/data/mingcheng/treemap_latest.png" width="500" />

My name is mingcheng(aka 明城). I'm originally from Ningbo, China, and currently based in Hangzhou.

I am employed at [Ant Group](https://github.com/antgroup) as an open-source evangelist. I maintain several open-source projects, such as [InclusionAI](https://github.com/inclusionAI) ([Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/inclusionAI)) Maintainer, [Dragonfly](https://github.com/dragonflyoss)(which is a CNCF Graduated Project) Maintainer, and [Apache Geaflow](https://github.com/apache/geaflow) Committee. And I'm on the Project Management Committee (PMC) in the [Apache Software Foundation](https://apache.org/). In addition, I'm also pursuing a master's degree in business analytics and data science at [SISU (Shanghai International Studies University)](https://shisu.edu.cn), from which I expect to graduate in 2026.

I'm passionate about programming languages. I primarily work with _Rust_, _Golang_, _TypeScript_, _Java_, _Python_, and _R_. I'm particularly excited about writing open-source projects in _Rust_ and _Golang_. Programming languages are not only just tools, but also they're a medium for exploring technology and expressing creativity to me. Currently, I'm learning more about _AI agents_, _data analytics_, and related fields.

Subsequently, I am enthusiastic about the Linux platform. I have a lot of experience with several Linux distributions, but _Debian_ and _Arch Linux_ are my favorites.  I am proficient in system administration, shell scripting, and automation. I enjoy discovering new tools and applications in the Linux ecosystem. Therefore, I am also a big lover of _macOS_, having used it for decades.
