My name is mingcheng(æ˜ŽåŸŽ). 

I currently reside in Hangzhou, and I grew up in Ningbo, a small city in mainland China's east.

I am a PPMC to the [Apache Software Foundation](https://apache.org/) and [SegmentFault](https://segmentfault.com/). I am also employed as an open-source evangelist in the open-source department ofÂ [Ant Group](https://github.com/antgroup) and the maintainer of the [InclusionAI project](https://github.com/inclusionAI)([Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/inclusionAI)). Furthermore, I am a student at [SISU (Shanghai International Studies University)](https://shisu.edu.cn).

My primary expertise is in Golang, Java, Python, PHP and DevOps, as well as development in frontend development(React).
