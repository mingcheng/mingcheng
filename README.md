## Greetings! ðŸ‘‹

<img align="right" alt="" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mingcheng/langstat/refs/heads/data/data/mingcheng/latest.png" width="500" />

My name is mingcheng(æ˜ŽåŸŽ). I'm originally from Ningbo, China, and currently based in Hangzhou.

I work as an open-source evangelist at [Ant Group](https://github.com/antgroup). I serve as a Project Management Committee (PMC) member for the [Apache Software Foundation](https://apache.org/) and maintain several open-source projects, including [InclusionAI](https://github.com/inclusionAI) ([Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/inclusionAI)) and [Dragonfly](https://github.com/dragonflyoss) (a CNCF incubating project). I'm also pursuing a Master's degree in Data Science and Business Analytics at [SISU (Shanghai International Studies University)](https://shisu.edu.cn).

As shown in the statistics above, I'm passionate about programming languages. I primarily work with Rust, Golang, TypeScript, Java, Python, and R. Programming languages are not only just tools, but also they're a medium for exploring technology and expressing creativity to me. I'm also enthusiastic about operating systems and cloud-native technologies, particularly Debian and Arch Linux.

You may find out more about me from [this link](https://mingche.ng), if you're interested.
