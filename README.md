## Greetings! ðŸ‘‹

<img align="right" alt="" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mingcheng/langstat/refs/heads/data/data/mingcheng/treemap_latest.png" width="350" />

My name is mingcheng(aka æ˜ŽåŸŽ). I'm originally from Ningbo, China, and currently based in Hangzhou.

I am employed at [Ant Group](https://github.com/antgroup) as an open-source evangelist. I maintain several open-source projects, such as [InclusionAI](https://github.com/inclusionAI) ([Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/inclusionAI)), [Dragonfly](https://github.com/dragonflyoss) (a CNCF incubating project), and [Apache Geaflow](https://github.com/apache/geaflow). And I'm on the Project Management Committee (PMC) in the [Apache Software Foundation](https://apache.org/). In addition, I'm also pursuing a master's degree in business analytics and data science at [SISU (Shanghai International Studies University)](https://shisu.edu.cn), from which I expect to graduate in 2026.

I'm enthusiastic about the Linux platform (My favorite distributions are Debian and Arch Linux which I used for them for decades). As shown in the statistics above, I'm passionate about programming languages. I primarily work with Rust, Golang, TypeScript, Java, Python and R. I'm particularly excited about writing open-source projects in Rust and Golang. Programming languages are not only just tools, but also they're a medium for exploring technology and expressing creativity to me. Currently, I'm learning more about AI agents, data analytics, and related fields.

You may find out more about me from [this link](https://mingche.ng), if you're interested.
