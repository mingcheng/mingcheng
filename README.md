My name is mingcheng(æ˜ŽåŸŽ). 

I was born and raised in Ningbo, a small city located in the eastern region of mainland China. At present, I'm living in Hangzhou.

I serve as a Project Management Committee(PMC) member for the [Apache Software Foundation](https://apache.org/), and I am employed as an open-source evangelist in the open-source department of [Ant Group](https://github.com/antgroup). Additionally, I am the maintainer of the [InclusionAI Project](https://github.com/inclusionAI)([Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/inclusionAI)) and the [Dragonfly Project](https://github.com/dragonflyoss), which is currently incubating at CNCF. In addition, I am also a student at [SISU (Shanghai International Studies University)](https://shisu.edu.cn).

My primary expertise is in Golang, Java, Python, PHP and DevOps, as well as development in frontend development(React). I am currently learning [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) to add to my list of skills.

You may find out more about me from [this link](https://mingche.ng), if you're interested.
