## Hi there! 👋

<img align="right" alt="" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mingcheng/langstat/refs/heads/data/data/mingcheng/treemap_latest.png" width="500" />

I'm mingcheng (明城), originally from Ningbo, China, and currently based in Hangzhou.

I work at [Ant Group](https://github.com/antgroup) as an open-source evangelist and serve on the Project Management Committee (PMC) of the [Apache Software Foundation](https://apache.org/). I maintain several open-source projects, including [InclusionAI](https://github.com/inclusionAI) ([Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/inclusionAI)), [Dragonfly (CNCF Graduated Project)](https://github.com/dragonflyoss), and [Apache Geaflow (Incubating)](https://github.com/apache/geaflow). I'm also pursuing a master's degree in business analytics and data science at [SISU](https://shisu.edu.cn), graduating in 2026.

I'm passionate about programming, primarily working with _Rust_, _Golang_, _TypeScript_, _Java_, _Python_, and _R_. To me, programming languages are more than tools—they're a medium for exploring technology and expressing creativity. Currently, I'm diving deeper into _AI agents_ and _data analytics_.

I am a _FreeBSD_ enthusiast and also a big fan of Linux (_Debian_ and _Arch_ are my favorites) and _macOS_. I enjoy system administration, shell scripting, automation, and discovering new tools in these ecosystems.
