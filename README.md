My name is mingcheng(明城). 

I currently reside in Hangzhou, and I grew up in Ningbo, a small city in mainland China's east.

I am a PPMC to the [Apache Software Foundation](https://apache.org/) and [SegmentFault](https://segmentfault.com/). I am also employed as an open-source evangelist in the open-source department of [Ant Group](https://github.com/antgroup). Furthermore, I am a student at [SISU (Shanghai International Studies University)](https://shisu.edu.cn).

My primary expertise is in Golang, Java, Python, PHP and DevOps, as well as development in frontend development(React).

I am currently learning [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) to add to my list of skills.
