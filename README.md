## GreetingsðŸ‘‹

My name is mingcheng(æ˜ŽåŸŽ). 

I live in Hangzhou, and I am a contributor to the [Apache Software Foundation](https://apache.org/) and [SegmentFault](https://segmentfault.com/). I am also employed in the open-source department of [Ant Group](https://github.com/antgroup). Furthermore, I am a student at [SISU (Shanghai International Studies University)](https://shisu.edu.cn).

My primary expertise is in frontend development(React), as well as development in Java, Go, and DevOps. 

I am currently learning Rust to add to my list of skills.
